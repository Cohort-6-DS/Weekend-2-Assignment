# Weekend-2-Assignment
eHarmony data


For this weekend's assignment we are looking at data from a  Marraige portal in this binary classification problem. The task is to predict that given certain features of the male and female, if a match can be predicted. The features are the following:

1) Age
2) Smoker?
3) Want Children?
4) List of Interests
5) Location


There are 5 features each for the male and female and the last column is the target. {0:No match,1:Match).

This data will require some preprocessing in terms of labelling and cleaning. The evaluation will be based on the AUROC curve so please be sure to calculate and print the curve.
